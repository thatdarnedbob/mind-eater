7dRL - The Mind Eater

This is a game I'm working on for the Seven-Day Rogue-Like challenge. Two big firsts for me: first game, first time using git for something, first python project of any length. If you see this project and think "why didn't he do THIS?" let me know because so much of this is new to me. Thanks for reading!

How to run this:

You need Python 2.7 and libtcodpy to run this game.

On my pc, it works in a folder with just MindEater.py, libtcodpy.py, libtcod-mingw.dll, SDL.dll, and the terminal12x12.png font from libtcod.

On a mac, it works in a folder with just MindEater.py, libtcodpy.py, cprotos.py (from libtcod), and the terminal12x12.png font.

In either case, just use 'python MindEater.py' from a command line to start the game. The necessary files are in the platform specific branches of this project; I don't know whether using these or getting them striaght to the source is better.

Some of this may be wrong because I am very bad at computers right now.
