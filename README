7dRL - The Mind Eater

This is a game I'm working on for the Seven-Day Rogue-Like challenge. Two big firsts for me: first game, first time using git for something, first python project of any length. If you see this project and think "why didn't he do THIS?" let me know because so much of this is new to me. Thanks for reading!

How to run this:

You need Python 2.7.

If you have that installed, it should be a matter of just running 'python MindEater.py' from inside the folders I'll provide.
